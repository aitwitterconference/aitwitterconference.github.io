## What is AITC?

The Artificial Intelligence Twitter Conference (AITC) is a free and open online gathering of minds for those who wish to discuss emerging AI research without spending significant conference fees, completing visa applications, and impacting the environment with air travel.

The virtual conference will take place entirely on Twitter. During the conference, presenters are invited to showcase their work to the audience inside threaded tweets by using the #AITC hashtag within their given slot. Audience members are also encouraged to join in the discussion using the same hashtag. The conference will last a total of 20 hours to ensure that audience and presenters across all timezones are able to participate in the conference.
