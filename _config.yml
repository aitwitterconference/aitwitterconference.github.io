# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing these this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Artificial Intelligence Twitter Conference is a free and open virtual conference hosted entirely on Twitter!
  We will be opening abstract submissions soon, and shortly after will publish our timeslots for presenters. The cost
  to take part in this conference is and always will be free. We believe in the public duty of communicating science without breaking the bank.
