Coodinated by Alexander Laurence, a Machine Learning student from the University of Oxford, AITC offers delegates and presenters an entirely online AI Conference hosted on Twitter. Best of all, AITC is free and open to all.

### Go Green

No travel means zero-carbon footprint (excl. power usage for your device). We are proud to be part of a growing movement of green twitter conferences.

### No Visa restrictions

Every year, hundreds of qualified delegates and conference speakers are refused entry to the host country due to issues in their visa applications. AITC solves this by being entirely online. 

### No Conference fees

We believe science should be free and open to all. Therefore, we hope to also use our platform as an opportunity for researchers within the low-income bracket to communicate their work with the wider AI-community.
